Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.

A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).

GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to:

Showcase or share your work.
Track and manage changes to your code over time.
Let others review your code, and make suggestions to improve it.
Collaborate on a shared project, without worrying that your changes will impact the work of your collaborators before you're ready to integrate them.
Collaborative working, one of GitHubâ€™s fundamental features, is made possible by the open-source software, Git, upon which GitHub is built.
